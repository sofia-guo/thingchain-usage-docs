    h2(style="color: green; text-align:center") 3. Distributor
    p
        | Bob works for the distributor, China House Inc. He receives the notification that New Zealand Co. has shipped the jars and moved the $500,000 funds into 
        | the SellSig. In 17 days, China House Inc. receives the shipment.
        
    p   
        | Verifying that the honey is undamaged, Bob proceeds to take posession of the shipment. He taps "possess shipment" in his app, which brings
        | him to a scanning screen. After scanning the private key, his identity address sends the key to the Thingchain server, along with his own identity address
        | (which are registered under New Zealand Co.) through the command "/popcode/possess". The value in the popcode is sent to Bob's identity address, recorded under
        | China House, Inc. in the Skuchain database.
    p
        | Bob must now mint new popcodes for unitized batches. The shipment will be distributed to these three retailers as such:
        
    ol
        li Lotte Mart: 50,000 jars (100 boxes); to be sold for $300,000
        li Walmart: 20,000 jars (40 boxes); to be sold for $120,000
        li Tesco: 30,000 jars (60 boxes), to be sold for $180,000
    ul
        li TOTAL: $600,000 in value
    p   
        | Bob taps on the "Remix popcodes" action in Tracer. He will need to mint three different popcodes for each of the different retailers, as each retailer is receiving
        | different amounts of honey. Each Smartbond with the corresponding retailer has already been established by now.
    p   
        | Tracer requires him to enter the batch information, including the associated serial number, units in the shipment, number of boxes, and associated value. Bob selects which retailer
        | will be receiving the shipment, which will link the proper popcodes to the corresponding Smartbond. There will be four smartbonds that Bob can see:
        
    ol
        li(style="color:red") New Zealand Co.: -$500,000
        li(style="color:green") Lotte Mart: +$300,000
        li(style="color:green") Walmart: +$120,000
        li(style="color:green") Tesco: +$180,000
        
    p
        | He taps the corresponding recipient's Smartbond. Tracer saves the link to the Skuchain server, then continues with remixing the existing batch's popcodes.
        | Bob taps "Remix Code", and Tracer send the command "/popcode/mix" to the Skuchain server. The Tracer app sends the information Bob entered about the number of boxes,
        | units, and associated serial number(s) of the boxes, which the server processes to produce a new popcode that will retain all the corresponding provenance.
    p
        | Bob completes the remixing for each of the three outbound shipments and sends the appropriate private codes and box codes to the printer. Once the jars have
        | shipped, Bob releases the popcode for the batch by going to the "Possess Shipment" portion of the app. He taps "Release shipment", and Tracer sends the command "/popcode/release" 
        | to the Thingchain server. Bob's identity sends the value back into the shipment popcode so that the retailers can take possession.
        
        | Bob opens the "Smartbond Check" option on his Tracer app. He moves the funds from Lotte Mart, Walmart, and Tesco into their corresponding SellSigs. The
        | chain of custody continues seamlessly to the 
        a(href='/docs/retailer.html') retailer.
