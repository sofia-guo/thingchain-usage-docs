        | Brenda lives in Hong Kong. After a long day at work, Brenda stops by at her local Lotte Mart to pick up a few groceries. As she walks through
        | the aisles, she remembers that her friend said eating Manuka honey could help reduce inflammation and sooth minor infections. Brenda, who
        | has a sore throat and inflamed acne, goes to the honey aisle and finds a variety of brands for Manuka honey. Each label looks very similar,
        | and all claim to have the highest potency and most authentic source. But Brenda knows that most of these are fake; how can she find the real thing?
        
    p
        | She sees a jar with a QR code on it and pulls out her smartphone. Luckily, Brenda installed an app called Tracer a few weeks ago, which allows her
        | to see the provenance of goods and confirm the authenticity of often-counterfeited products in China. The Tracer app will display the provenance
        | of the goods only if the code is managed by Skuchain. This assures Brenda that the information given by the QR code is authentic.
    p
        | On her Tracer screen, she chooses the "Scan" screen. The app automatically detects the code and pulls up the information contained in the code. Brenda 
        | sees that the honey was shipped from Sunny Bear Farms two weeks ago, to the exact date. She can see the total amount of miles the food has traveled, in
        | addition to any potential allergen risks to her specifically (managed by settings she put on Tracer during the app registration). The application also pulls
        | up recent reviews of the product (through her cellular connection) culled from Google and a summary of suggestions for usage.
    p
        | Satisfied with the reviews, Brenda checks one last aspect on her phone; whether or not the honey fits into her budget. In Tracer's settings, Brenda has
        | inputted her weekly budget for all the different parts of her regular shopping: food, health, fitness, and other. She sees that the honey's Â¥49.71 ($8) price
        | fits into her budget. Brenda is good to go and buys the honey.
        
    p
        | After a few weeks, Brenda goes back to Lotte Mart to pick up another jar. Scanning the code on the jar she picks up to verify authenticity, she sees a special
        | promotion window pop up. She has picked up the 1,000,000th jar! After buying the jar, she scans the code again, and this time the pop up window allows her 
        | to tap on the button which says "Claim prize". After claiming her prize of a printable coupon for a free jar, Brenda is now directly connected to the brand
        | New Zealand, Co. Honey., and the company can continue to develop the one-to-one marketing relationship with Brenda without additional effort.
