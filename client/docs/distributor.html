Distributor</h2><p>Bob works for the distributor, China House Inc. He receives the notification that New Zealand Co. has shipped the jars and moved the $500,000 funds into 
the SellSig. In 17 days, China House Inc. receives the shipment.</p><p>  
Verifying that the honey is undamaged, Bob proceeds to take posession of the shipment. He taps "possess shipment" in his app, which brings
him to a scanning screen. After scanning the private key, his identity address sends the key to the Thingchain server, along with his own identity address
(which are registered under New Zealand Co.) through the command "/popcode/possess". The value in the popcode is sent to Bob's identity address, recorded under
China House, Inc. in the Skuchain database.</p><p>Bob must now mint new popcodes for unitized batches. The shipment will be distributed to these three retailers as such:</p><ol><li>Lotte Mart: 50,000 jars (100 boxes); to be sold for $300,000</li><li>Walmart: 20,000 jars (40 boxes); to be sold for $120,000</li><li>Tesco: 30,000 jars (60 boxes), to be sold for $180,000</li></ol><ul><li>TOTAL: $600,000 in value</li></ul><p>  
Bob taps on the "Remix popcodes" action in Tracer. He will need to mint three different popcodes for each of the different retailers, as each retailer is receiving
different amounts of honey. Each Smartbond with the corresponding retailer has already been established by now.</p><p>  
Tracer requires him to enter the batch information, including the associated serial number, units in the shipment, number of boxes, and associated value. Bob selects which retailer
will be receiving the shipment, which will link the proper popcodes to the corresponding Smartbond. There will be four smartbonds that Bob can see:</p><ol><li style="color:red">New Zealand Co.: -$500,000</li><li style="color:green">Lotte Mart: +$300,000</li><li style="color:green">Walmart: +$120,000</li><li style="color:green">Tesco: +$180,000</li></ol><p>He taps the corresponding recipient's Smartbond. Tracer saves the link to the Skuchain server, then continues with remixing the existing batch's popcodes.
Bob taps "Remix Code", and Tracer send the command "/popcode/mix" to the Skuchain server. The Tracer app sends the information Bob entered about the number of boxes,
units, and associated serial number(s) of the boxes, which the server processes to produce a new popcode that will retain all the corresponding provenance.</p><p>Bob completes the remixing for each of the three outbound shipments and sends the appropriate private codes and box codes to the printer. Once the jars have
shipped, Bob releases the popcode for the batch by going to the "Possess Shipment" portion of the app. He taps "Release shipment", and Tracer sends the command "/popcode/release" 
to the Thingchain server. Bob's identity sends the value back into the shipment popcode so that the retailers can take possession.
Bob opens the "Smartbond Check" option on his Tracer app. He moves the funds from Lotte Mart, Walmart, and Tesco into their corresponding SellSigs. The
chain of custody continues seamlessly to the <a href="/docs/retailer.html">retailer.</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script>$("#menu-toggle").click(function(e) {
