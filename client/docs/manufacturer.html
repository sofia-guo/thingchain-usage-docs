Manufacturer</h2><p>Sunny Bear Farms produces honey in Christchurch, New Zealand. Every two weeks, they receive orders from their 
exporter, New Zealand Company. The Farm received an order for 100k jars of honey, which will eventually be shipped to 
various retailers in China.</p><p>John, who is responsible for overseeing packaging and shipment of the honey, takes out his smartphone and opens the "Tracer"
mobile app, which is connected via the internet to Thingchain. As a manufacturer, Sunny Bear Farms purchased the appropriate version
of the application. John taps on "Mint New Batch" from the home screen.</p><p>The app requires John to input the batch information:</p><ol><li>Product serial number</li><li>Value (Ex: 700,000 USD)</li><li>Weight (Ex: 5,000 kg)</li><li>Total Units (Ex: 100,000 jars)</li><li>Shipment Date</li><li>Units per package (500 jars per shipment package)</li></ol><p>John completes the fields.</p><p>When he taps the "Next" button, the application submits the batch information to the Skuchain Cloud.
The cloud recognizes John's device and finds John's identity/key pair. John's identity address withdraws a 
value from the Thingchain faucet using the operation "/faucet/withdraw". The app uses John's userID, idAddress, the entered value (100k),
units of measurement (jars of honey), and the serial number, weight, and shipment date (metadata) to complete the parameters for the operation. </p><p>Tracer then submits the retrieved value to the popcode's address in the Skuchain cloud, which begins working on the command for "/popcode/derive". The numPopcodes (100), BatchId, sequat, and userID
are all entered by the application. Popcodes for the batch are derived, and the app recieves the codes' private keys and address information, 
which it will convert to a QR code. John's identity is used to sign the transaction which desposits value at the derived popcode's address.
Once the transaction is completed, the Skuchain cloud broadcasts the transaction to Thingchain.</p><p>  
John checks the amount of popcodes to be printed: 100k "child-codes" for each jar, 200 codes for the 500 jars/box of shipment boxes, and
one private key to accompany the entire shipment. When all is correct, he taps the "send to printer" button.</p><p>  
Tracer, which is connected to the printer, sends the popcodes out. While the printer begins, John returns to the home screen, where he can check on the status of
this batch's Smartbond. He sees the batch ID of the just-minted batch in the "Unclaimed" appear, and seals the process by tapping on the batch to claim.
Tracer notifies the Skuchain server to move funds worth $400,000 from the BuySig to the SellSig on Sunny Bear Farms' and their Exporter's (New Zealand Co.)
SmartBond. Sunny Bear Farms will wait for the pre-determined amount of time that the money will sit in the SellSig; if New Zealand Co. is satisfied with the shipment upon
receiving the 200 boxes, they will release the funds for Sunny Bear to claim after the time limit ends. Meanwhile, the chain of custody moves on to the <a href="/docs/exporter.html">exporter.</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script>$("#menu-toggle").click(function(e) {
