When the custody of goods is passed from one address to another,
the transaction is recorded into Thingchain.</p><p>A Smartbond is a multi-sig address on the Bitcoin Blockchain which allows Buyers and Sellers to interact in a trustable way in all phases of a commerce transaction. 
It replaces  Letters of Credit, Open Account and other trade finance instruments using secure cryptography. This allows Sellers to get paid faster, 
Buyers to get deep visibility into their supply chain and Banks to significantly reduce their fiduciary responsibility.</p><p>A BuySig is a digital address which holds the monetary value of the designated Smartbond deal for t amount of time (agreed to between the
two parties involved). A seller can only move the funds to a SellSig after they have minted/possessed/released popcodes
and the t amount of time has elasped.</p><p>A SellSig is a digital address which holds the monetary value of the designated Smartbond deal for t amount of predetermined
time. A seller can only withdraw the funds to their own personal address after t amount of time has elasped. However, if during
the t amount of time the buyer is dissatisfied with the goods, he/she may place a hold on the funds in the SellSig. This will
alert a predetermined arbitrator to enter and sort out the issue.</p><a href="https://thingchain.com/api">Full API reference</a><p></p><a href="https://thingchain.com/doc">Thingchain API Introduction</a></div></div></div></div></div><script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script>$("#menu-toggle").click(function(e) {
