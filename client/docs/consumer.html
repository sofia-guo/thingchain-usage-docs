Brenda lives in Hong Kong. After a long day at work, Brenda stops by at her local Lotte Mart to pick up a few groceries. As she walks through
the aisles, she remembers that her friend said eating Manuka honey could help reduce inflammation and sooth minor infections. Brenda, who
has a sore throat and inflamed acne, goes to the honey aisle and finds a variety of brands for Manuka honey. Each label looks very similar,
and all claim to have the highest potency and most authentic source. But Brenda knows that most of these are fake; how can she find the real thing?</p><p>She sees a jar with a QR code on it and pulls out her smartphone. Luckily, Brenda installed an app called Tracer a few weeks ago, which allows her
to see the provenance of goods and confirm the authenticity of often-counterfeited products in China. The Tracer app will display the provenance
of the goods only if the code is managed by Skuchain. This assures Brenda that the information given by the QR code is authentic.</p><p>On her Tracer screen, she chooses the "Scan" screen. The app automatically detects the code and pulls up the information contained in the code. Brenda 
sees that the honey was shipped from Sunny Bear Farms two weeks ago, to the exact date. She can see the total amount of miles the food has traveled, in
addition to any potential allergen risks to her specifically (managed by settings she put on Tracer during the app registration). The application also pulls
up recent reviews of the product (through her cellular connection) culled from Google and a summary of suggestions for usage.</p><p>Satisfied with the reviews, Brenda checks one last aspect on her phone; whether or not the honey fits into her budget. In Tracer's settings, Brenda has
inputted her weekly budget for all the different parts of her regular shopping: food, health, fitness, and other. She sees that the honey's ¥49.71 ($8) price
fits into her budget. Brenda is good to go and buys the honey.</p><p>After a few weeks, Brenda goes back to Lotte Mart to pick up another jar. Scanning the code on the jar she picks up to verify authenticity, she sees a special
promotion window pop up. She has picked up the 1,000,000th jar! After buying the jar, she scans the code again, and this time the pop up window allows her 
to tap on the button which says "Claim prize". After claiming her prize of a printable coupon for a free jar, Brenda is now directly connected to the brand
New Zealand, Co. Honey., and the company can continue to develop the one-to-one marketing relationship with Brenda without additional effort.</p></div></div></div></div></div><script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script>$("#menu-toggle").click(function(e) {
